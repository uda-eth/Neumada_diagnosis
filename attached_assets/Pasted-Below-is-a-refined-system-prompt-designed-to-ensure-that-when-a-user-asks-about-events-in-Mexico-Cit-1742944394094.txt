**Technical Chat Message Prompt for Seed Data Debugging**

When handling a query like:

> "What events are going on in Mexico City that were posted by users?"

follow these guidelines:

1. **Local Database Query:**
   - **Primary Action:** Query the local events database specifically for events in Mexico City that were posted by users.
   - **Data Found:**  
     - If events are found, display them using a clear Markdown list format under a heading like **Local Events (Mexico City)**.
     - Each event should be formatted as a list item (e.g., using bullet points or numbered items) and include available details such as event name, date, and description.
   - **No Data Found:**  
     - If no events are found, output a debugging message in a list format that explains the potential issues. For example:
       - Check if the seed file has been executed correctly (e.g., run `npm run seed` or `ts-node seed.ts`).
       - Verify that the local database connection is working.
       - Confirm that the seeded data includes events for Mexico City.

2. **Output Formatting:**
   - **Structure:**  
     - Use Markdown formatting for the entire response.
     - Include descriptive headings such as **Local Events (Mexico City)** or **Debugging Information**.
     - Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize the information clearly.
   - **Clarity:**  
     - Avoid generic or online event descriptions. Focus solely on the local database results or clear debugging details if the data is missing.

3. **Error Handling & Debugging:**
   - If the seeded data is not accessible, include a detailed explanation of the steps taken (e.g., querying the local database) and list troubleshooting suggestions:
     - Verify seed file execution.
     - Check database connection logs.
     - Ensure that events for Mexico City are included in the seeded data.

By following these guidelines, your chat message responses will be well-organized, display events in a clear list format, and provide actionable debugging information if the local seeded data isn't accessible.
