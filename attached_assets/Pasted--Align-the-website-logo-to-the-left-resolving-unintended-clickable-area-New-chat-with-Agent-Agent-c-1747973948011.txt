Search the file base for the following task:

I want you to diagnosis the logic sorrounding making profile pictures a required field when creating user profiles. Curently i believe that there is logic implemented for that but users are still able to create profiles without adding a photo so its not working correctly right now

I'll diagnose the profile picture requirement issue. After examining the codebase, I found the problem:

In the ProfileSetupPage.tsx and ReplitProfilePage.tsx files, there's client-side validation to check if an image is uploaded before submission, but there's an issue with how it's implemented.

In ReplitProfilePage.tsx, the form validation schema doesn't properly validate that a profile image exists. The current implementation uses z.any() for the profileImage field, which doesn't enforce a required check:

const profileSchema = z.object({
  // other fields...
  profileImage: z.any(), // This doesn't enforce that an image is required
});
And in the form submission logic, there's a manual check for imagePreview, but if this check fails, it only shows a toast and sets a form error - it doesn't actually prevent form submission properly.

Here's my proposed fix:

client/src/pages/ReplitProfilePage.tsx
Additionally, I'd recommend adding a similar fix to the ProfileSetupPage.tsx to maintain consistency across the application. The issue isn't just in the validation schema, but also in how the form submission logic is handled.

The key problem was that even though there was validation logic checking for the profile image, the code was still allowing submission to proceed. The fix ensures the submission process is correctly halted if no profile image is selected.

Looking at the issue, I'll now fix the profile image requirement implementation in the ProfileSetupPage.tsx file. The problem is that while the ReplitProfilePage.tsx was fixed, we still need to apply the same fix to the ProfileSetupPage.tsx to ensure users can't submit forms without a profile image.

client/src/pages/ProfileSetupPage.tsx
The changes above implement proper validation for the profile image in the ProfileSetupPage.tsx file. The key changes are:

Added a check in the onSubmit function to prevent form submission if no profile image is provided
Added a visual indication (asterisk) next to the "Profile Picture" label to show users that it's a required field
Updated the description text to explicitly state that the profile photo is required
These changes ensure consistent behavior with the ReplitProfilePage.tsx that was previously fixed, creating a uniform user experience across both profile creation pages.
