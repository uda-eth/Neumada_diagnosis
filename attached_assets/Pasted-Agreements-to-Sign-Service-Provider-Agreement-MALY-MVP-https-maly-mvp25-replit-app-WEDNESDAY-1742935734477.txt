MALY MVP - https://maly-mvp25.replit.app/

WEDNESDAY CALL REVIEW

DISCOVER
Cities List - when selected should have a pop-up message that says this market is coming soon. Be the first here, invite members there or create your own happening! (COPY NEEDED FOR NEW CITY CTA)
Event Display -  in ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù needs to show profile icons of ‚ÄúInterested (Saved/Liked)‚Äù members and ‚ÄúGoing‚Äù - Can be 3 profile images plus # interested. This should also be displayed when they click on the event itself and see its main page. If the profile icons / # interested/going is engaged it should create a drop down list of all the members profiles and when selected takes you to there main profile page.
Filter by Time Frame
Recommended
This week
Next Month sections
FILTER by Time Frame (Today, This Week, This Weekend, This Month, Next Month) 
The Event Host Profile - on the bottom of the main page of event should demonstrate photo of the profile icon and when engaged show full profile for message
Follow Button (We currently dont have rules around ‚ÄúFollow) vs. ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù
Buy ticketbutton to payment gateway (ticketing)
Back button on Members Profiles in CONNECT needs to be directed back to Connect Main screen not Discovery
REFERRAL Links Display - (Reference Mozi) 


ADD REFERRAL BUTTON (INVITE) REPLIT REFERENCE. VISIBLE ALL PAGES


Event Display -  in Grid Format on both Desktop and Mobile (2 or 3 horizontal) and Down similar to connect member display vs. single event at a time. 
MENU
Inbox button/icon be visible from Desktop and Mobile main pages rather than only in menu?

INBOX
UX/UI Issues -I don‚Äôt currently like the UX/UI on Inbox and profile images should appear. We should remove the dark box element around each text thread. Use inbox best practices.





PROFILE
Profile Edit Page - We formerly had a page that was dedicated to editing your profile. Looked great but the button is currently not working. Perhaps prompt replit. Be insured it has edit MOOD, Interest, Display Name, remove AGE from displaying on profile. 
Add to Profile = 

Currently: 
Born:
Raised: 
Lived: 
Upcoming:

CONNECT
ADD -  a Male/Female/Other Filter, Gay/Straight/Bi/Other, 
ADD or REMOVE - When the connect button is hit on a persons profile we should make a contacts button and have those displayed in the profile page or hidden in settings
MOOD - Lets spotlight filtering by MOOD and make that the main focus on the filter section.
